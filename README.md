# Quality Floater
A forum app invoking a novel system to rank social media posts via binary-weighted tags.

The relevance of a user's feedback is logarithmically scaled based on feedback that user has received. Only positive feedback is allowed, with users choosing from a curated list of qualities, such as intelligence, empathy and creativity.

Thus, through positive feedback loops, quality users and quality posts float to the top.
